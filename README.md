# 1st WIC Bohinj Lake 2025
This project is about a simple site I created to register votes about worst ideas me and my friends had during our camping adventure in Bohinj Lake (SLO) during summer '25.
Google forms? No, thanks, Python instead.
In a nutshell, I wrote down ideas with correspondent authors and let everyone choose their favourite three ideas in order to avoid autovoting case depending on the username; the results are then linked to a personal Google Sheet page which tracks all the votes and allows to select the winners and make other basic statistics.

## HOW TO USE
From local terminal: `streamlit run app4.py`
Alternatively you can just click on the link related to my personal project folder on Streamlit.
